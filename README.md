# ebay helper for your orders 

This script is for sellers who get many orders with multi items.  
it is to add checkboxes next to the items in your order.  

it also enlarge the quality text and highlight.  

Greasemonkey or tampermonkey add-on is requeired.  
tampermonkey and scriptcat will work.   

I work on desktop most of the time.  
I am not sure if it will work on mobile browsers.
